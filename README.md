# Kinetic Modeling in PET Imaging 
## Overview:
This project implements kinetic modeling of PET imaging data, focusing on:
1. Processing time-activity curves (TACs) to quantify radiotracer uptake in different regions.
2. Fitting kinetic models to estimate rate constants and clearance values.
3. Performing statistical analysis to assess the reliability of extracted parameters.
